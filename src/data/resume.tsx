		"I love building scalable and efficient applications to solve problems. Currently looking for full-time opportunities as a Software Developer.",
	summary:
		"I'm passionate about building impactful solutions for real-world problems. In the past year, I collaborated with a team of four and a mental health expert to develop Serenity Harbor, an OpenAI-powered application for assistance. I've also made contributions to Sugarizer, an open-source education platform. My experience spans various projects, including creating a full-stack app for file storage, developing a Chrome extension for LLM-based job application auto-fill, and building a beautiful landing page for a business. \n\n I've worked on fun projects too, like an Alexa skill for coding contest notifications and a Discord bot for playing lofi music ðŸ˜‰ I love participating in hackathons to challenge myself. One of my proudest achievements was mentoring 125 students, helping them sharpen their skills in problem-solving, data structures, and algorithms. I'm always excited to explore new platforms and technologies!",
